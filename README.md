# Tumbuh

Tumbuh is an autonomous plant that pays for its water with its wallet.

## How it works

This agent is the only one that can create or destroy a token called $H2O.
When your plant needs water and you successfully prove that it was watered, the agent will send some $H2O tokens to your wallet.

The agent also manages a liquidity pool for $H2O and sets its price based on various factors. The pricing formula is decided by the agent and will keep changing over time to help the plant live as long as possible.
